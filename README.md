==============

Exercises for a course in haskell.

Note that exercises were intended to be evaluated from within ghci (ie with :l exercise_1.hs).

Also, some of the exercises depend on external dependencies provided by the course, and which are not part of this repository.
These exercises, therefore won't run out of the box.
